In recent years, image deblurring has been widely investigated.
In order to solve this ill-posed problem, a variety of prior models
have been proposed successively. The two-tone prior has been successfully
applied to text images deblurring and achieved significant results. However,
the natural image with rich color clusters does not meet the two-tone prior,
which requires only two color clusters in the image.
